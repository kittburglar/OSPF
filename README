I built and tested my router program on the schoolâ€™s linux servers. This mean I should be using the same version of make and java compiler that is on the school linux servers.

1. On a hostX, run the network emulator (nse-linux386). An example of running the network emulator looks like this:

./nse-linux386 hostY 9999 
or
./nse-linux386 ubuntu1204-006.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9999

2. On the hostY, run the routers which you get by running "make". You can run each router in a different shell but they must be on the same host.
   An example of running the routers looks like this:

In shell 1:
java router 1 hostX 9999 9991
In shell 2:
java router 2 hostX 9999 9992
In shell 3:
java router 3 hostX 9999 9993
In shell 4:
java router 4 hostX 9999 9994
In shell 5;
java router 5 hostX 9999 9995
or
In shell 1:
@ubuntu1204-006% java router 1 ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9999 9991
In shell 2:
@ubuntu1204-006% java router 2 ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9999 9992
In shell 3:
@ubuntu1204-006% java router 3 ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9999 9993
In shell 4:
@ubuntu1204-006% java router 4 ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9999 9994
In shell 5:
@ubuntu1204-006% java router 5 ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9999 9995

If the router automatically returns, then try a different port. 
If the nse does not respond after running a router, then try a different port (last argument). 
After these 5 routers are run, there should be router log files which display the 
Link State Database and Routing Information Protocol changes by running OSPF.

The routers will continue to listen for Link State Database Protocol Units (LSPDU) Packets.
You must manually stop the running router program to stop the router (CTRL + C).
